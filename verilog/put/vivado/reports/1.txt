INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/azureuser/btreeBlock/vivado/constraints/xc7v2000tflg1925-1.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/put_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/put_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Phase 9 Verifying routed nets
CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-162] 18409 signals failed to route due to routing congestion. Please run report_route_status to get a full summary of the design's routing.
Below is a list of the top 10 physical nodes with signal overlaps and up to 5 of the signals that were contending for this node resource:
Resolution: Run report_route_status to get a full summary of the design's routing. To find the areas of the congestion, use the route congestion Metrics in the Device View and check the logfile for the Congestion Report.
