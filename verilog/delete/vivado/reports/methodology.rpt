2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-9#1 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at leaf_1_StuckSA_Memory_Based_26_base_offset_reg[7]_i_3 of size 6x4, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at leaf_1_StuckSA_Memory_Based_26_base_offset_reg[9]_i_7 of size 6x4, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>
