# C [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) 
The goal is to produce a [C programming language](https://b-ok.xyz/book/633119/db5c78) language [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) of the [B-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) algorithm and run it
on a soft [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) on the same [Field Programmable Gate Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) used to run the [B-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) algorithm, to compare its
performance with that of the [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning). 
If the [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) is significantly faster than the [C programming language](https://b-ok.xyz/book/633119/db5c78) [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning), then we
can, like Rabbit, say "Aha" and go and try to sell it to someone.
