<p>Data centers often use one hundred times as much power as other businesses
according to the Wall Street Journal, and this percentage is increasing year by
year.</p>

<p>That is more than the total amount of electricity consumed by these major
global cities:</p>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2.1 trillion â
equivalent to the GDP of Italy.</p>

<p>Data centers do a lot of [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups. Every company has a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) and
spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in their database.</p>

<p>If we could make [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups more efficient, [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) centers would save a
lot of money on their electricity bills â perhaps $100 million per year.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Ltd Inc. is prototyping a specialized [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) [chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) to perform [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups 10 times more efficiently and 10 times faster than
conventional computers can.</p>

<p>This is not a new idea.</p>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a graphics processing unit (GPU)
implemented in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) rather than [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) because the original software-only
versions were too slow, and the mobile phone was the size of a brick. The same
applies to every personal computer.</p>

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done in just [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). You could easily mine a few
bitcoins every day with a generic notebook [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer). Now, you need to use a
specialized Bitcoin miner that does most of that processing in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) rather than software.</p>

<p>Network Bitcoin mining used to be done in just [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). You could easily

<p>Implementing [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) will [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators be
more competitive by reducing their cost per [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookup.</p>

<p>Appa Apps has just succeeded in synthesizing the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) algorithm, ready
for placement on a field-programmable [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array) (FPGA).</p>

<p>We are going to compare the performance of our specialized implementation of
the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) algorithm with the performance of a generic [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) running the
same algorithm.</p>

<p>If our specialized [chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) can do [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups significantly faster using
less power than the generic computers currently used by [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators,
then we are going to send them copies of the [chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) so that they can see for
themselves that they are wasting money on their electricity bills unless they
buy our chips.</p>

<p>We need to raise $1M to buy [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) to demonstrate our technology, [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) engineers to implement our technology in an actual FPGA, and sales and
marketing personnel to present our findings to the major [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators
with the goal of getting letters of intent to buy from them.</p>

<p>If they are willing to sign letters of intent to buy such [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) when they
become available, we will use those letters to drive a large Series A funding
round and get into the business of saving the planet by reducing electricity
consumption per [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookup and making a lot of money while we do so.</p>
