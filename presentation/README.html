<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>Data centers often use one hundred times as much power as other businesses
according to the Wall Street Journal, and this percentage is increasing year by
year.</p>

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>That is more than the total amount of electricity consumed by these major
global cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators like to locate their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers
close to reliable supplies of cheap electricity.

<p>For example, Gmail is located near the Boneville Dam in The Cascades, Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2.1 trillion annually â
equivalent to the GDP of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>


<p>Data centers do a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookups. Every company has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> and
every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>
quickly for their demanding customers.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>If we could make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookups more efficient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers would save a
lot of money on their electricity bills â perhaps $100 million per year.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Ltd Inc. is prototyping a specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> to perform
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookups using 10 times less electricity while doing the look up 10
times faster than generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>s can.</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<h2>This is not a new idea.</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a graphics processing unit (GPU)
implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> because the original software-only
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a>s were too slow while the mobile phone was the size of a brick. Every
personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> has a GPU now-a-days for the same reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done in just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>. Now, you
need to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of
that processing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> effectively in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center
operators be more competitive by reducing their cost per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookup while
speeding up such look-ups at the same time.</p>

<p>Appa Apps has just succeeded in synthesizing a Verilog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a> of the well
known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm normally written in the C programming language, ready
for placement on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">field programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">gate</a> array</a> (FPGA).</p>

<p><img src="images/fpga.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">Roadmap</h2>

<p>We are going to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">field programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">gate</a> array</a> mounted on a card to compare the performance of
our specialized implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm with the performance
of a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> running the same algorithm in conventional code.</p>

<p><img src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">

<p>If our specialized implementation can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookups significantly
faster using less power than the generic implementation, then we are going to
send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators copies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">field programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">gate</a> array</a> on a card so that they can plug it
in and see for themselves that they are currently wasting money, needlessly, on
their electricity bills unless they use our design.</p>

<p><img src="images/DatabaseOnAnFPGA.png">

<p>We need to raise $1M to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> to demonstrate our technology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a>
engineers to implement our technology on an actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">field programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">gate</a> array</a> connected to the real
world via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, and sales and marketing personnel to present our findings
to the major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators with the goal of getting letters of intent
from them indicating that they are interested in buying our chips.</p>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they are willing to sign letters of intent to buy such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s when they
become available, we will use those letters to drive a large Series A funding
round and get into the business of saving the planet by reducing the
electricity consumed by each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> while making a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps?</h3>

<p>Just me and ChatGpt</p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p>A class C corporation registered in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is very useful as it does all the  boring low-level coding letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">code</a>.

<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>None at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the last
two years with no space for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s are starting to give way to
specialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s.

<li>The AI boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor factories that produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s because they thought that they would
need a lot of capacity until DeepSeek proved otherwise by wiping $700 billion
off value of Nvidia in one day.

<li>AI makes it possible to explore the myriad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.
