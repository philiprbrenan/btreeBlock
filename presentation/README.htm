<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>Data centers often use one hundred times as much power as other businesses
according to the Wall Street Journal, and this percentage is increasing year by
year.</p>

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>That is more than the total amount of electricity consumed by these major
global cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators like to locate their [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) centers
close to reliable supplies of cheap electricity.

<p>For example, Gmail is located near the Boneville Dam in The Cascades, Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2.1 trillion annually â
equivalent to the GDP of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>


<p>Data centers do a lot of [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups. Every company has a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) and
every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in their [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) quickly for their demanding customers.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>If we could make [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups more efficient, [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) centers would save a
lot of money on their electricity bills â perhaps $100 million per year.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Ltd Inc. is prototyping a specialized [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) [chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) to perform [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups using 10 times less electricity while doing the look up 10
times faster than generic computers can.</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<h2>This is not a new idea.</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a graphics processing unit (GPU)
implemented in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) rather than [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) because the original software-only
versions were too slow while the mobile phone was the size of a brick. Every
personal [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) has a GPU now-a-days for the same reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done in just [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer). Now, you
need to use a [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of
that processing in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) effectively in [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) will [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center
operators be more competitive by reducing their cost per [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookup while
speeding up such look-ups at the same time.</p>

<p>Appa Apps has just succeeded in synthesizing a Verilog [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) of the well
known [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) algorithm normally written in the C programming language, ready
for placement on an [field programmable [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (FPGA).</p>

<p><img src="images/fpga.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">Roadmap</h2>

<p>We are going to use a [field programmable [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) mounted on a card to compare the performance of
our specialized implementation of the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) algorithm with the performance
of a generic [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) running the same algorithm in conventional code.</p>

<p><img src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">

<p>If our specialized implementation can do [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) lookups significantly
faster using less power than the generic implementation, then we are going to
send [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators copies of the [field programmable [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) on a card so that they can plug it
in and see for themselves that they are currently wasting money, needlessly, on
their electricity bills unless they use our design.</p>

<p><img src="images/DatabaseOnAnFPGA.png">

<p>We need to raise $1M to buy [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) to demonstrate our technology, [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) engineers to implement our technology on an actual [field programmable [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) connected to the real
world via [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet), and sales and marketing personnel to present our findings
to the major [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) center operators with the goal of getting letters of intent
from them indicating that they are interested in buying our chips.</p>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they are willing to sign letters of intent to buy such [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) when they
become available, we will use those letters to drive a large Series A funding
round and get into the business of saving the planet by reducing the
electricity consumed by each [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) while making a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps?</h3>

<p>Just me and ChatGpt</p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p>A class C corporation registered in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is very useful as it does all the  boring low-level coding letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, to [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). 
<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>None at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the last
two years with no space for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) are starting to give way to
specialist [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit). 
<li>The AI boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor factories that produce [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) because they thought that they would
need a lot of capacity until DeepSeek proved otherwise by wiping $700 billion
off value of Nvidia in one day.

<li>AI makes it possible to explore the myriad [chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.
