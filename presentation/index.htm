<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>Data centers often use one hundred times as much power as other businesses
do, according to the Wall Street Journal, and this percentage is steadily
increasing year by year.</p>

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>That is more than the combined total amount of electricity consumed by these
major global cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, data center operators like to locate their data centers
close to reliable supplies of cheap electricity.

<p><img src="images/PowerConsumptionOfMajorTechCompanies.png"/>

<p>For example, Gmail is located near the Bonneville Dam in The Cascades, on
the River Columbia, in Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2 trillion annually -
equivalent to the GDP of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>

<p>Data centers do a lot of database look-ups. Every company has a database and
every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in their database
quickly for their demanding customers.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>If we could make database look-ups more efficient, data centers would save a
bit of money on their electricity bills - perhaps $100 million per year.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is prototyping a specialized silicon chip to perform
database look-ups using 10 times less electricity while doing the look up 10
times faster than generic computers can.</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<h2>This is not a new idea...</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a graphics processing unit (GPU)
implemented in silicon rather than software because the original, software-only
versions were too slow; while the mobile phone was the size of a brick. Every
personal computer has a GPU now-a-days for much the same reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done using just software. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook computer. Now, you
need to use a factory full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of their
processing in silicon rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing database software effectively in silicon will help data center
operators be more competitive by reducing their cost per database look-up while
speeding up such look-ups at the same time.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. has just succeeded in synthesizing a Verilog version of the
well known database algorithm normally written in the C programming language,
ready for placement on an fpga (FPGA).</p>

<p><img src="images/fpga.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">Roadmap</h2>

<p>We are going to use a fpga mounted on a card to compare the performance of
our specialized implementation of the database algorithm with the performance
of a generic computer, implemented on the same fpga, running the same algorithm
written in conventional code.</p>

<p><img id="tugOfWar" src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">

<p>Assuming our specialized fpga implementation can do database look-ups
significantly faster using less power than the comparable generic
implementation, then we are going to send data center operators copies of the
fpga mounted on a card so that they can plug it in and see for themselves that
they are currently wasting money, needlessly, on their electricity bills unless
they use our design.</p>

<p><img src="images/DatabaseOnAnFPGA.png">

<p>We aim to raise $1M to:

<ol>

<li>Buy hardware to demonstrate our technology,

<li>Hire hardware engineers to implement our technology on an actual fpga
connected to the real world via ethernet,

<li>Hire sales and marketing personnel to present our findings to the major
data center operators with the goal of getting letters of intent from them
indicating that they are interested in buying chips based on our design.

</ol>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they are willing to sign letters of intent to buy such chips, we will use
those letters to drive a large Series <b>A</b> funding round and get into the
business of saving the planet by reducing the electricity consumed by each
database look-up while making a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps Inc?</h3>

<p>Just me and chatgpt </p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p>chatgpt is very useful as it does all the  boring low-level coding letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, to code.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is a class <b>C</b> corporation registered in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>None at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the last
two years with no time for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic chips are starting to give way to
specialist chips.

<li>The AI boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor factories that produce chips because they thought that they would
need a lot of capacity until DeepSeek proved otherwise.

<li>AI makes it possible to explore the myriad chip design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.
